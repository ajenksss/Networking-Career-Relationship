# Networking-Career-Relationship
This project explores how networking—through mentorship programs and professional groups—correlates with career success. Using a Kaggle dataset containing 5,000 records of students' educational backgrounds, skills, and career outcomes, I analyze whether networking activities contribute to higher salaries and better job placement rates.

Objective:
The goal is to determine whether mentorship and professional networking significantly impact job placement success and starting salary among graduates. By leveraging data analysis techniques, this project provides insights into the value of networking in professional growth.

Key Analysis Areas:

Correlation between Networking Score and Starting Salary
Influence of mentorship participation on number of job offers received
Relationship between Networking Score and Career Satisfaction
Statistical comparisons between high and low networkers
Tools & Techniques Used:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Verified dataset integrity, handled missing values (none found), and categorized networking levels.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used pivot tables, box plots, and bar charts to identify trends.
Statistical Analysis: Ran t-tests and correlation analysis to measure the significance of networking’s impact.
Data Visualization: Created graphs and insights to highlight key findings.
