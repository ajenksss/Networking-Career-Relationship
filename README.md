# Networking-Career-Relationship
This project explores how networking—through mentorship programs and professional groups—correlates with career success. Using a Kaggle dataset containing 5,000 records of students' educational backgrounds, skills, and career outcomes, I analyze whether networking activities contribute to higher salaries and better job placement rates.
